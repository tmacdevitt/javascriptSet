# javascriptSet

The goal of this project is to create a version of set modified for computer play.  The following additions to the regular game have been made:

1. There is a 60 second timer that the match must be made in before three cards are removed from the play area
2. There is always at least one match in the play area
3. There is a hint button which will highlight one card which is part of a set in the play area
4. There is a scoring mechanism to the game
     A match is scored in the following manner
       50 points for a match made with a hint
       100 points for a match made without a hint
       0-60 additional points is added to the score based on how much time is left on the timer
5. There are optional SFX in the game
6. During the last 5 seconds an alarm klaxon sounds

   Future work would be to add additional settings
